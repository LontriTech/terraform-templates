# Terraform Templates

Terraform Templates meta-repository.

# What it does

It is a "living catalog" all the submodules in it can be used directly or indirectly.

Also, there's no need to update it, there's automation for that.

# How it works

This repository holds references to all repositories inside the organization with names starting with "terraform" and ending in "template" as submodules.

It runs auto updates on a daily basis.
